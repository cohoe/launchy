Currently working on: 

In XP, icons don't show up

Trying to stylize the scrollbar is difficult

If you simply go to "switch user" and then come back in, the alpha border is fucked.  I tried recalling UpdateLayeredWindow and that didn't really help.  Reapplying the entire skin does work though.  WTF?

There are memory leaks everywhere.

If I keep the concept of labels, then the getIcon() function doesn't need to use QDir()::exists, it can just check for a directory label



Why does Qt::WindowStaysOnTopHint cause the program to close?

Todo:
. When reindexing, always update the current search afterwards
. Make sure gSearchTxt is set before sort

KNOWN PROBLEMS:


LAPTOP CHANGES:
1) Set global main window variable in constructor of main
