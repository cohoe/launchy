Black Glass Skin (v. 1.0) for Launchy (v. 0.9.2)
by Peter Wooley - 04.26.2006

To install the Black Glass skin, go to your Launchy Folder, presumably C:/Program Files/Launchy
Inside the Launchy folder, copy the blackGlass folder (in this directory) into the Launchy/Skins directory, presumably C:/Program Files/Launchy/Skins
Once copied, exit Launchy and restart. (Right-click Launchy and select Exit to exit)
Next, Right Click on Launchy, select Skins and select "Black Glass".
Launchy should now reset its skin and you'll be good to go!

I've included the .psd file for anyone to play with.

Let me know of any problems in the skin or this document by contacting me at:

Enjoy the Skin!
