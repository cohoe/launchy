Currently working on: 

When I type in say "c:\dev\big" and try to use the dropdown to complete it it doesn't do anything on the top item

when there are no suggested results, run them as arguments to the first thing

When a db is done building, redo the search on the current text

Trying to stylize the scrollbar is difficult

If you simply go to "switch user" and then come back in, the alpha border is fucked.  I tried recalling UpdateLayeredWindow and that didn't really help.  Reapplying the entire skin does work though.  WTF?

Memory leaks?


Why does Qt::WindowStaysOnTopHint cause the program to close?

Todo:
. When reindexing, always update the current search afterwards
. Make sure gSearchTxt is set before sort

KNOWN PROBLEMS:
Icons don't show up if wrong color setting (16-bit)
