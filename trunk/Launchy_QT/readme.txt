To deal with for alpha release:




Currently working on: 

Seems like the database is getting hosed every now and then, "webstats" loses its count from time to time

Add "open with" support

Are the files being written/read in unicode?  Check on firefox bookmarks too.

when there are no suggested results, run them as arguments to the first thing

When a db is done building, redo the search on the current text

Trying to stylize the scrollbar is difficult

Playing with the options tab on xp machine caused crashes when the plugins weren't loaded

Rescanning the database caused the rescan to freeze at around 76%, couldn't do any more scans after that


Memory leaks?


Why does Qt::WindowStaysOnTopHint cause the program to close?

Todo:
. When reindexing, always update the current search afterwards
. Make sure gSearchTxt is set before sort

KNOWN PROBLEMS:
Icons don't show up if wrong color setting (16-bit)
Options not being saved on laptop



XP issue:
I've installed the vc_redist.. so the SXS for the VC runtime is there.. and still plugins won't load.  Is it a QT issue then?
