Building on Linux:

For debian and ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev libboost-dev g++
make ; sudo make install



Building on WINDOWS:

Requirements: 
1) Visual Studio 2008 w/ SP1
2) QT 4.5 or greater
3) Boost


Installing QT:
. Download QT SDK at: https://qt.nokia.com/products
. Run the installer

. Setting the QT environment variables:
. Go to control panel -> System -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables
. Add these 2 variables to your user variables
. Variable = QMAKESPEC    Value = win32-msvc2008
. Variable = QTDIR        Value = c:\qt\2009.03

. Type "2008 command prompt" into Launchy to get a VS enabled command prompt
. cd c:\qt\2009.03\
. configure -no-stl -no-qt3support -no-webkit -debug-and-release -platform win32-msvc2008
. nmake


The configure and nmake commands take a very long time.

Once it is built, you have a *very* nice QT documentation program in c:\qt\2009.03\qt\bin\assistant.exe

Download Boost from http://www.boost.org/users/download/
Install Boost libraries to c:\boost


Building Launchy:

. Download launchy from subversion, the url to use is this: https://launchy.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/launchy/trunk/Launchy_QT/
. Double click on launchyQT\win\Launchy.sln
. F7 to compile!


When you run Launchy, note that only one skin is installed in the debug\release directories.  
Launchy looks awfully funny when it can't find its skin!
