Building on Linux:

For debian and ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev libboost-dev g++
make ; sudo make install



Building on WINDOWS:

Requirements: 
1) Visual Studio 2005 w/ SP1
2) QT 4.3 or greater


Installing QT:
. Download QT src zip file at: http://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/windows
. Unzip the contents into c:\qt\4.x.x\ where x.x is the version number e.g. 4.3.3
. Move all of the files in the "qt-win-opensource-src-4.x.x" folder up a directory into your 4.x.x directory

 . Setting the QT environment variables:
  . Go to control panel -> System -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables
  . Add these 2 variables to your user variables
    . Variable = QMAKESPEC    Value = win32-msvc2005
    . Variable = QTDIR        Value = c:\qt\4.x.x\

. Type "2005 command prompt" into Launchy to get a VS enabled command prompt
. cd c:\qt\4.x.x\  (e.g. c:\qt\4.3.3\)
. configure -no-stl -no-qt3support -debug-and-release
. nmake


The configure and nmake commands take a very long time.

Once it is built, you have a *very* nice QT documentation program in c:\qt\4.x.x\bin\assistant.exe




Building Launchy:

. Download launchy from subversion, the url to use is this: https://launchy.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/launchy/trunk/Launchy_QT/
. Double click on launchyQT\win\Launchy.sln
. F7 to compile!


Note that everything should build except for calcy.  Calcy requires the BOOST library headers to be installed in c:\boost\boost\  You can build the rest of Launchy just fine without calcy.


When you run Launchy, note that only one skin is installed in the debug\release directories.  
Launchy looks awfully funny when it can't find its skin!
